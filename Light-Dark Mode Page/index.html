        <h1>THE TIGER</h1>
    <p><small>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is one of the most iconic and majestic big cats, renowned for its power, 
        grace, and striking appearance. Native to various parts of Asia, tigers inhabit a range of environments 
        from tropical forests to grasslands and wetlands. They are the largest members of the cat family, with males often 
        weighing up to 660 pounds and bmeasuring up to 11 feet in length including the tail. Tigers are solitary and territorial 
        animals, known for their distinctive orange coats adorned with black stripes, which provide excellent camouflage in their 
        natural habitats. They are apex predators, relying on their strength, stealth, and acute senses to hunt prey such as 
        deer, wild boar, and even water buffalo. Despite their revered status and cultural significance, tigers face severe threats 
        from habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, leading to their classification as an endangered species with fewer than 
        4,000 individuals remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure the survival of these magnificent creatures for
        future generations.</small></p>
